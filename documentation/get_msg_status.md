# Get message status

Message status depends on the type of message that you have sent.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## Status - text and email

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Created|The message is queued to be sent to the provider. The notification usually remains in this state for a few seconds.|
|Sending|The message is queued to be sent by the provider to the recipient, and GOV.UK Notify is waiting for delivery information.|
|Delivered|The message was successfully delivered.|
|Failed|This covers all failure statuses:<br>- `permanent-failure` - "The provider was unable to deliver message, email or phone number does not exist; remove this recipient from your list"<br>- `temporary-failure` - "The provider was unable to deliver message, email inbox was full or phone was turned off; you can try to send the message again"<br>- `technical-failure` - "Notify had a technical failure; you can try to send the message again"|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Status|Information|
|:---|:---|
|Pending|GOV.UK Notify received a callback from the provider but the device has not yet responded. Another callback from the provider determines the final status of the notification.|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## Status - letter

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Received|The provider has received the letter to deliver.|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## Get the status of one message

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```php
getNotification( $notificationId )
```

For example:

```php
try {
    $response = $notifyClient->getNotification( 'c32e9c89-a423-42d2-85b7-a21cd4486a2a' );
} catch (NotifyException $e){}
```

### Arguments

#### notification_id (required)

The ID of the notification. You can find the notification ID in the response to the [original notification method call](/python.html#get-the-status-of-one-message-response).

You can also find it in your [GOV.UK Notify Dashboard](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk).

1. Sign in to GOV.UK Notify and select __Dashboard__.
1. Select either __emails sent__, __text messages sent__, or __letters sent__.
1. Select the relevant notification.
1. Copy the notification ID from the end of the page URL, for example `https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/services/af90d4cb-ae88-4a7c-a197-5c30c7db423b/notification/ID`.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns an `array`:

```php
[
    "id" => "notify_id",
    "body" => "Hello Foo",
    "subject" => "null|email_subject",
    "reference" => "client reference",
    "email_address" => "email address",
    "phone_number" => "phone number",
    "line_1" => "full name of a person or company",
    "line_2" => "123 The Street",
    "line_3" => "Some Area",
    "line_4" => "Some Town",
    "line_5" => "Some county",
    "line_6" => "Something else",
    "postcode" => "postcode",
    "type" => "sms|letter|email",
    "status" => "current status",
    "template" => [
        "version" => 1,
        "id" => 1,
        "uri" => "/template/{id}/{version}"
     ],
    "created_at" => "created at",
    "sent_at" => "sent to provider at",
];
```

### Error codes

If the request is not successful, the client will return an `Alphagov\Notifications\Exception\NotifyException` object containing the relevant error code:

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|exc->getCode()|exc->getErrors()|How to fix|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`400`|`[{`<br>`"error": "ValidationError",`<br>`"message": "id is not a valid UUID"`<br>`}]`|Check the notification ID.|
|`403`|`[{`<br>`"error": "AuthError",`<br>`"message": "Error: Your system clock must be accurate to within 30 seconds"`<br>`}]`|Check your system clock.|
|`403`|`[{`<br>`"error": "AuthError",`<br>`"message": "Invalid token: signature, api token not found"`<br>`}]`|Use the correct API key. Refer to [API keys](#api-keys) for more information.|
|`404`|`[{`<br>`"error": "NoResultFound",`<br>`"message": "No result found"`<br>`}]`|Check the notification ID.|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

## Get the status of multiple messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 messages and statuses. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get the status of messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```php
listNotifications( array $filters = array() )
```

```php
    $response = $notifyClient->listNotifications([
        'older_than' => 'c32e9c89-a423-42d2-85b7-a21cd4486a2a',
        'reference' => 'weekly-reminders',
        'status' => 'delivered',
        'template_type' => 'sms'
    ]);
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next 250 oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

### Arguments

You can leave out any of these arguments to ignore these filters.

#### template_type (optional)

You can filter by:

* `email`
* `sms`

```php
$reference = 'STRING',
```

You can leave out this argument to ignore this filter.

#### older_than (optional)

Input the ID of a notification into this argument. If you use this argument, the method returns the next 250 received notifications older than the specified ID.

```php
older_than='740e5834-3a29-46b4-9a6f-16142fde533a'
```

If you leave out this argument, the method returns the most recent 250 notifications.
